## [Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/)
Microsoft Cognitive Services is a collection of Representational State Transfer (RESTful) intelligent application program interfaces (APIs) that allow systems to see, hear, speak, understand, and interpret people’s needs by using natural methods of communication. Developers can use these APIs to make their applications more intelligent, engaging, and discoverable.

With Cognitive Services, developers can easily add intelligent features—such as emotion and sentiment detection, vision and speech recognition, knowledge, search, and language understanding—into their applications. The collection of APIs will continuously expand, adding new APIs and improving existing ones.
